# Banking Holiday Funding Processes

This section addresses operational procedures for scenarios where the bank is closed for a holiday, but the stock market remains open for trading (e.g., Columbus Day, Veterans Day).

# Funding & JIT

<br />

**Bank Holiday but Markets Trading:** The stock market will be open and trading as usual, but banks will be closed for the federal holiday.

**JIT Operations Continue as Normal:** Our Just-in-Time (JIT) funding operations will continue to run without interruption.

**Still Reconcile and Send Reports:** Partners should continue to reconcile trades and send required reports on time for both the preceding trading day and the market open holiday.

**Partners Should Treat as Two Separate Normal Trading Days:** Both the preceding trading day and the market open holiday trading sessions should be processed as distinct, regular trading days.

**Settlement Due for Holiday & Next Business Day:** Settlement Amount is Required by 1:00 PM EST business day after the bank holiday for Payment.

**Two Separate Wires on the First Business Day After a Holiday:** Partners should anticipate two distinct wire transfers on the morning of the first business day following a holiday — one representing the settlement from the prior business day and the other for the settlement on the holiday itself.

**Implementing Safety Measures to Prevent Amount Errors:** Our Engineering team have enhanced safety measures and checks to ensure accuracy and prevent any amount errors related to the dual-day settlement.

# Instant Funding

**Code Fixed to Base on Trade Settlement vs. Bank Holidays:** Our Instant Funding logic has been fixed to prioritize the trade settlement schedule over bank holidays, ensuring more consistent processing.

**Partners Need Settlement Amount by 1 PM ET:** Partners must provide the necessary settlement amount by 1:00 PM ET on the bank holiday to ensure Instant Funding is processed for payment on the next bank business day.

**RF Account Option for Instant Settlement During Holidays:** Partners can utilize the RF account option for instant settlement of funds during bank holiday periods.

**Partners Can Pre-Fund to Avoid Limit Issues:** We encourage partners to pre-fund their accounts ahead of long weekends or holidays where applicable to avoid hitting pre-set funding limits.

# Funds Processing

**Currency Cloud Transactions May Still Post:** Funds sent using Currency Cloud may still post to your account on a bank holiday, provided the transaction does not pass through a US bank for final processing.

**Wire Transfers and ACH Will Not Be Processed:** All standard US-based Wire Transfers and ACH transactions will be paused and will not be processed on the bank holiday. Processing will resume on the next bank business day.
