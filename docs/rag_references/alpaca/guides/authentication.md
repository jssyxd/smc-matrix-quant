# Authentication

# How to call our API

Alpaca's APIs are available under different domain names, and you first need to make sure that you are calling the right one. This page describes the machine-to-machine authentication types available in the following scenarios:

* If you have a live account, you can call:
  * Trading API endpoints on `api.alpaca.markets`
  * Market Data API endpoints on `data.alpaca.markets`
* If you have a paper account, you can call:
  * Trading API endpoints on `paper-api.alpaca.markets`
  * Market Data API endpoints on `data.alpaca.markets`
* If you are a live broker partner, you can call:
  * Broker API endpoints on `broker-api.alpaca.markets`
  * Market Data API endpoints on `data.alpaca.markets`
  * Authentication endpoints on `authx.alpaca.markets`
* If you are a sandbox broker partner, you can call:
  * Broker API endpoints on `broker-api.sandbox.alpaca.markets`
  * Market Data API endpoints on `data.sandbox.alpaca.markets`
  * Authentication endpoints on `authx.sandbox.alpaca.markets`

If you have more than one account (or in case of broker partners, more than one correspondent), each of those have separate credentials. As an example, you cannot use your live account's credentials with the paper API, or vice versa.

# Authentication flows

## Client credentials

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  The Client Credentials authentication flow is not yet available for Trading API.
</Callout>

When using this flow, you first need to exchange your credentials for a short-lived access token, then use that token to authenticate with our API. Do not request a new access token for each API call. Access tokens issued by our token endpoint are valid for 15 minutes.

We offer two types of credentials you can use with this flow:

* Use a client ID and a client secret (`client_secret`) - this is easier, as you can simply pass the secret that was generated when you created your credentials to our token endpoint. Note that we only support passing the client secret in the request body (`client_secret_post`), not in the `Authorization` header (`client_secret_basic`).
* Use a client ID and a signed client assertion (`private_key_jwt`) - this ensures that the private key used to sign client assertions never leaves your custody, but it requires you to construct and sign a JWT token with a private key before each call to the token endpoint. See [RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html#section-2.2) for more information on how to do so.

As an example, here is how a Broker API user would request an access token from our [token endpoint](../reference/issuetokens) using the first method:

```curl
curl -X POST "https://authx.alpaca.markets/v1/oauth2/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     -d "client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}" \
     -d "client_secret={YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}"
```

The response will contain an access token:

```json
{
    "access_token": "{TOKEN}",
    "expires_in": 899,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

The returned token can be used to authenticate with Broker API:

```curl
curl -X GET "https://broker-api.alpaca.markets/v1/accounts" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"
```

## Legacy

Our older authentication flow lets you authenticate with your key ID and secret key directly. You have two options to authenticate your requests:

* Use HTTP Basic Authentication, send your key ID as the username, and your secret key as the password.
* Use the `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` headers to send your key ID and secret key.

As an example, here is how a Trading API user would authenticate with our API using the second method:

```curl
curl -X GET "https://api.alpaca.markets/v2/account" \
     -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: {YOUR_API_KEY_ID}" \
     -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: {YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY}"
```
