# OmniSub

**What is OmniSub and how is it legally structured?**

OmniSub is Alpaca’s omnibus account model that features internal sub-accounting. The structure is an omnibus brokerage account held by the partner at Alpaca Securities LLC. The sub-accounting layer is a technology solution provided by Alpaca DB and the sub-accounts are not considered fully disclosed broker accounts to Alpaca Securities LLC. Alpaca DB provides the technology layer to power your front-end customer experience while the only brokerage account opened will be the omni brokerage account.

A Partner, such as a broker or fintech, holds this single legal omnibus account, while all individual customer balances and activities are tracked as distinct "sub-accounts" within Alpaca DB systems for operational and reporting purposes.

***

**How are accounts structured in the OmniSub model?**

The model consists of three key components:

* Omnibus Account: This is the single, legal brokerage account that the partner establishes and owns at Alpaca Securities LLC. All aggregate activity from the sub-accounts rolls up into this account.
* Sub-accounts: These are not brokerage accounts of Alpaca Securities LLC, but are internal, technology-based records for tracking each end-customer's positions and activities. They are managed by the partner via API.

***

**Can I trade directly from the omnibus account?**

No, direct trading is disabled at the omnibus account level. All trading activities must originate from and be executed exclusively through the individual sub-accounts or the designated Default Account.

***

**Will I be able to see sub-accounts in Brokerdash?**

Yes, partners have visibility into their individual sub-accounts within Brokerdash, our partner dashboard. This view also includes two system accounts: the default account (for holding residuals) and a control account (for operational adjustments).

***

**Who is responsible for KYC/CIP and AML for the end-customers?**

The partner is solely responsible for all end-customer compliance. This includes:

* KYC/CIP: The partner must conduct their own comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Identification Program (CIP) procedures for all end-customers.
* AML: The partner is primarily responsible for end-customer Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring based on their own policies. While end-customer PII is not shared, the granular nature of sub-accounts gives Alpaca enhanced internal visibility to monitor transactions.
* Your AML program will be reviewed during onboarding as part of due diligence.

***

**How is tax reporting managed?**

Alpaca's tax reporting responsibility is limited to the omnibus account level only.

The partner is fully responsible for all tax reporting obligations for their individual end-customers.

***

**What funding methods are supported and how do they work?**

All funding activities (deposits, withdrawals) are performed centrally at the omnibus account level. OmniSub supports two main models:

* Pre-funding (Aggregated): The partner deposits funds into the omnibus account in advance. Before a client sub-account can trade, the partner must allocate funds from the omnibus account to the sub-account.
* Post-Trade Net Settlement (No Buying Power Checks): Trades can be executed without pre-funding up to a pre-set limit. At the end of the day, all trades are netted, and the partner settles the final net debit or credit balance. This model significantly optimizes capital efficiency.

***

**How are trades executed?**

Trades are placed at the sub-account level via API. The system then automatically mirrors these trades into the omnibus account to facilitate settlement, clearing, and regulatory reporting.

***

**How are corporate actions handled?**

Mandatory Corporate Actions: Events like dividends, stock splits, and mergers are processed simultaneously at both the sub-account and the omnibus account levels to ensure consistency. Any rounding residuals are booked to a designated control account.

***

**Why might a sub-account be blocked from trading?**

This is typically due to a pending corporate action. To ensure positions and balances are accurate, Alpaca will set trading\_blocked = true on a sub-account if corporate action processing is not complete before market open. Partners can monitor this status via the API.

***

**Who provides official statements and trade confirmations to the end customer?**

The Partner is always responsible for providing official statements and confirms to end clients. Alpaca provides the necessary JSON data for sub-accounts and official statements for the omnibus account to facilitate this.

***

**What is the process for error handling and trade corrections?**

* Alpaca Securities LLC’s Responsibility: Venue-related trade corrections (e.g., from exchange errors) and Client-originated errors (e.g., incorrect order entry) are handled by Alpaca Securities LLC.
* Processing: All trade corrections and busts are processed at the sub-account level and automatically propagate to the omnibus account to maintain reconciliation. The partner is responsible for addressing any resulting debit balances in a sub-account.

***

**How are ACATS handled?**

* Incoming ACATS: Asset transfers are allocated to the specified sub-account, and the partner is responsible for validating the allocation.
* Outgoing ACATS: The partner has a 24-hour validation window to approve an outgoing transfer request before Alpaca processes it.

***

**Do I need to handle my own CAT (Consolidated Audit Trail) reporting?**

Alpaca Securities LLC handles CAT reporting at the omnibus account level.

***

**Can I migrate my existing Fully-Disclosed accounts to an OmniSub model?**

It’s important to consider what’s important for your business as each business is unique. Alpaca will review your request and make a determination. Alpaca has a semi-automated process for this migration.

***

**Can my sub-accounts operate in a different currency than the omnibus account?**

No. All sub-accounts must use the same base currency as the parent omnibus account.

***

**How do I create a sub-account via the API?**

A partner can create a sub-account by calling the Broker API.
