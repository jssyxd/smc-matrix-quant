# ITM Option Expiry

In the event of an in-the-money (ITM) option reaching expiration without being designated as "Do Not Exercise" (DNE), the Alpaca system will automatically initiate the exercise process on behalf of the user. This process mirrors the Exercise event described earlier. In cases where there is insufficient buying power or underlying positions to facilitate the exercise, the system will generate an automated order for the liquidation of the position.

# OTM Option Expiry

```
[
  {
    "id": "20190801011955195::5f596936-6f23-4cef-bdf1-3806aae57dbf",
    "activity_type": "OPEXP",
    "date": "2023-07-21",
    "net_amount": "0",
    "description": "Option Expiry",
    "symbol": "AAPL230721C00150000",
    "qty": "-2",
    "status": "executed"
  }
]
```

When a contract expires OTM, the Alpaca system will flatten the position and no further action is taken.
