# Pagination of Results

Pagination is handled using the `page_token` and `page_size` parameters.

`page_token` represents the ID of the end of your current page of results. If specified with a direction of desc, for example, the results will end before the activity with the specified ID. If specified with a direction of `asc`, results will begin with the activity immediately after the one specified. `page_size` is the maximum number of entries to return in the response. If `date` is not specified, the default and maximum value is 100. If `date` is specified, the default behavior is to return all results, and there is no maximum page size.
