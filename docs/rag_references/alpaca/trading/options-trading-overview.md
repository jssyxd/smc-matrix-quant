# Options Enablement

## Enabling Options Trading on a new Account

Per FINRA Rule 2360, each customer account has to be approved for options before the first options trade is made. Once options trading is enabled on a correspondent you can start requesting accounts to be approved for options trading. For existing accounts there will be a few new data points that need to be [patched](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/patchaccount-1) on the account along with a new options agreement that the customer will need to sign. Below are the new fields that will need to be provided specifically for options.

* Annual Income
* Net Worth
* Liquid Net Worth
* Liquidity Needs
* Investment Experience
* Investment Risk Tolerance
* Investment Objective
* Investment Time Horizon
* Marital Status
* Number of Dependents

Below is an example of a request for opening a new account with options enabled. More details on creating an account can be found [here](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/createaccount-1)**.**

## Enabling Options Trading on an existing Account

Below are sample requests and responses for enabling options trading on an existing account, using the approval [endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/requestoptionsforaccount).

Example: Account with level 1 requirements requesting for level 1 options trading approval

```json Request
{
  "level": 1   
}
```

```json Response
{
    "id": "43c2f8a9-9e39-48b1-921c-e510dfeeff47",
    "account_id": "492b6297-45fc-4435-abc7-08ab15480b1c",
    "created_at": "2024-05-14T04:34:03.527165162-04:00",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-14T04:34:03.527165162-04:00",
    "requested_level": 1,
    "status": "APPROVED"
}
```

Example:  Account with level 1 requirements requesting for level 2 options trading approval

```json Request
{
  "level": 2   
}
```

```json Response
{
    "id": "43c2f8a9-9e39-48b1-921c-e510dfeeff47",
    "account_id": "492b6297-45fc-4435-abc7-08ab15480b1c",
    "created_at": "2024-05-14T04:34:03.527165162-04:00",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-14T04:34:03.527165162-04:00",
    "requested_level": 2,
    "status": "LOWER_LEVEL_APPROVED"
}
```

### Options Approval Statuses

| Status                 | Description                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPROVED`             | User has been approved for requested options trading level.                        |
| `LOWER_LEVEL_APPROVED` | User has been approved for a lower level than the requested options trading level. |
| `PENDING`              | Pending manual review                                                              |
| `REJECTED`             | User has been rejected for requested options trading level.                        |

### Approval fixtures

Options Approval API supports approval fixtures in the Sandbox environment. You can pass the desired approval level and approval status to test all different scenario of options approval flow (approved, lower\_level\_approved, rejected) to the same approval [endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/requestoptionsforaccount).

Example use cases:

1. Requesting an `APPROVED` status for options trading level 1

```json JSON
{
  "level": 1,   
  "fixtures": {
    "status":"APPROVED"
  }
}
```

2. Requesting an `REJECTED` status for options trading level 2

```json JSON
{
  "level": 2,   
  "fixtures": {
    "status":"REJECTED"
  }
}
```

3. Requesting a `LOWER_LEVEL_APPROVED` status (simulating a flow where level 2 was requested but user is approved for level 2 instead)

```json JSON
{
  "level": 2,   
  "fixtures": {
    "status":"LOWER_LEVEL_APPROVED",
    "level":1
  }
}
```

## Downgrading/disabling Options

Once an account is approved for options trading the customer has the ability to downgrade the options level or disable it altogether. This is done by setting the max\_options\_trading\_level via the trading account configuration [endpoint.](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/patch-patch-v1-trading-accounts-account_id-account-configurations-1)

Once the max options trading level is set the options trading level on the trading account endpoint will get upgraded to the value set by the user. Note the options trading level will always be the same or lower than the options approved level. Below is an example of a user being approved for level 2 but downgrading to level 1.

```json
{
  ...
  "options_approved_level": 2,
  "options_trading_level": 1,
  ...
}
```

      <td>
        User must have sufficient options buying power
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Trading Level Validation

If a user tries to trade a strategy above their level this will result in an error message. Below is an example of a user who is approved for level 1 trying to place a level 2 options trade.

```json
{
   "code": 40310000,
   "message": "account not eligible for level2 options trading"
}
```

## Asset Master

Similar to the asset master for securities and crypto there is an options contract [endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/get-options-contracts-1) which will return all the options contract for an underlying symbol. Below is a sample

```json
{
  "id": "1fb904df-961a-4a07-a924-53a437626db2",
  "symbol": "AAPL240223C00095000",
  "name": "AAPL Feb 23 2024 95 Call",
  "status": "active",
  "tradable": true,
  "expiration_date": "2024-02-23",
  "root_symbol": "AAPL",
  "underlying_symbol": "AAPL",
  "underlying_asset_id": "b0b6dd9d-8b9b-48a9-ba46-b9d54906e415",
  "type": "call",
  "style": "american",
  "strike_price": "95",
  "size": "100",
  "open_interest": "12",
  "open_interest_date": "2024-02-22",
  "close_price": "89.35",
  "close_price_date": "2024-02-22"
 }
```

## Order Examples

**Buying a call**

```json
{  
  "symbol": "PTON240126C00000500",  
  "qty": "1",  
  "side":"buy",  
  "type": "market",  
  "time_in_force": "day"  
}
```

**Buying a put**

```json
{  
  "symbol": "TSLA240126P00210000",  
  "qty": "1",  
  "side": "buy",  
  "type": "market",  
  "time_in_force": "day"  
}
```

**Selling a covered call**

```json
{  
  "symbol": "AAPL240126C00050000", 
  "qty": "1", 
  "side": "sell", 
  "type": "market", 
  "time_in_force": "day"  
}
```

**Selling a cash secured put**

```json
{  
  "symbol": "QS240126P00006500",  
  "qty": "1",  
  "side": "sell",  
  "type": "market",  
  "time_in_force": "day"  
}
```

## Buying Power Checks

With options we introduce a new field on the[ trading account endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/gettradingaccount-1) called options\_buying\_power which is evaluated when trying to open new options positions.

For both **buying a call** or **buying a put** sufficient buying power is necessary to pay for the premium of the contract otherwise an error will occur as shown below.

```json
{
"options_buying_power": "7267.84",
"code": 40310000,
"cost_basis": "38000",
"message": "insufficient options buying power"
}
```

For **Selling Covered Call** you need to have enough stocks as collateral otherwise the order will error out as shown below.

```json
 {
   "available_qty": "0",
   "code": 40310000,
   "message": "insufficient underlying qty available for covered call (required: 100, available: 0)",
   "required_qty": "100",
   "symbol": "AAPL240126C00050000",
   "underlying_asset_id": "b0b6dd9d-8b9b-48a9-ba46-b9d54906e415"
}
```

For **selling cash secured put** you will need enough buying power to pay for the underlying stock minus the premium that would be received otherwise the order will error out as shown below

```json
{
  "buying_power": "9395",
  "code": 40310000,
  "message": "insufficient options buying power for cash-secured put (required: 20310, available: 9395)",
  "required_options_buying_power": "20310"
}
```

# Positions

Option positions will show up like any other position in the positions endpoint. Below is an example of an options position.

```json
{
  "asset_id": "fe4f43e5-60a4-4269-ba4c-3d304444d58b",
  "symbol": "PTON240126C00000500",
  "exchange": "",
  "asset_class": "us_option",
  "asset_marginable": true,
  "qty": "2",
  "avg_entry_price": "6.05",
  "side": "long",
  "market_value": "1068",
  "cost_basis": "1210",
  "unrealized_pl": "-142",
  "unrealized_plpc": "-0.1173553719008264",

}
```

# Post Trade

## Exercising

As the buyer of an option (call or put), the holder has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the option's underlying security at a specified price on or before a specified date in the future. If the holder decides to act on those rights they are choosing to exercise. An option can be exercised via the exercise [endpoint](https://docs.alpaca.markets/v1.1/reference/optionexercise-1) and instructions for DNE (do not exercise) instructions can be supplied via [Do not exercise](https://docs.alpaca.markets/reference/optiondonotexercise-1) endpoint. Note exercise requests will be processed instantly and requests sent outside of market hours will be rejected. When exercising there will be 2 new activities per exercise which are:

* **OPEXC** - removes the options position as a result of exercising
* **OPTRD** - trading activity that is paired with the exercising

### Exercising Call

A long call exercise results in **buying the underlying stock** at the strike price. Below is an example of this.

```json
{
  "id": "20240227000000000::197118f0-afd8-4adb-b154-167f4a87b1f5",
  "account_id": "21c36b57-2304-4e5b-8364-8effbcba853e",

},

{

  "account_id": "21c36b57-2304-4e5b-8364-8effbcba853e",
  "activity_type": "OPTRD",
  "date": "2024-02-27",
  "net_amount": "-650",
  "description": "Option Trade",
  "symbol": "QS",
  "qty": "100",
  "price": "6.5",
  "status": "executed"
}
```

### Exercising Put

A long put exercise results in **selling the underlying stock** at the strike price. Below is an example of this.

```json JSON
{
  "id": "20240227000000000::f62ee8f5-0279-4e81-9bd1-4ef197c7b2f3",
  "account_id": "21c36b57-2304-4e5b-8364-8effbcba853e",
  "activity_type": "OPEXC",
  "date": "2024-02-27",
  "net_amount": "0",
  "description": "Option Exercise",
  "symbol": "QS240301P00006500",
  "qty": "-1",
  "status": "executed"
},

{
  "id": "20240227000000000::74e1db8e-9316-4dcf-b69c-50f51427b7c1",
  "account_id": "21c36b57-2304-4e5b-8364-8effbcba853e",

  "date": "2024-02-27",
  "net_amount": "650",
  "description": "Option Trade",
  "symbol": "QS",
  "qty": "-100",
  "price": "6.5",
  "status": "executed"
}

```

## Assignment

When selling an options contract (call or put) the user collects a premium but in turn takes on the obligation to buy or sell the stock at the agreed upon strike price if assigned. It is important to note that the OCC assigns a random account and sellers of contracts can be assigned overnight. When assigned there will be 2 new activities per assignment which are:

* **OPASN** - removes the options position as a result of assignment
* **OPTRD** - trading activity that is paired with the assignment

### Call Assignment

For call options, the seller takes on the **obligation to sell** the stock at the agreed upon strike price. Below is an example of activities that result as a result of a call assignment

```json
 {
   "id": "20240301000000000::001140db-3947-456b-aefc-253861fb65df",

### Put Assignment

For put options, the seller takes on the **obligation to buy** the stock at the agreed upon strike price. Below is an example of activities that result as a result of a put assignment

```json

  "id": "20240301000000000::fcd92e5c-46e4-4c6e-8866-d56cd7d2bde2",

## Expiration

Unlike stocks, option contracts have an expiration date. If the user does not close out their position or exercise their options (if they have the buying power to support the exercise), Alpaca will need to potentially take action on it for risk management purposes based on the criteria described below.

* Starting at 3:30 pm EST on the date of expiration, Alpaca continuously evaluates any open positions that expire that day and stops accepting new orders to open/extend any positions.
* If the position for a long call or put **is ITM (in the money)** by .01 or more, Alpaca checks if the account has enough buying power to exercise in the case of a call or enough shares in the case of a put
  * If there is **enough buying power or shares** Alpaca will not liquidate the options and will let the option auto-exercise.
  * If there is **not enough buying power or shares**, then Alpaca will liquidate while it’s still ITM
* If the position **is for a covered call or cash secured put and ITM** by .01 or more **Alpaca will automatically assign after close on date of expiry**
* If the position **is not ITM**  in other words it’s **ATM (at the money)** or **OTM (out of the money)**, Alpaca may skip it and it will expire after close as shown in the examples below. (Note that positions slightly OTM may also be liquidated depending on market and underlying conditions. Alpaca will take into consideration fast moving markets and/or fast stocks that may be moving from ITM and OTM throughout the day. There may be instances where OTM positions are also closed out.)

# Market Data

Alpaca provides access to options market data (at a cost) in the same user-friendly format it does for stocks and crypto. Additionally, we can refer partners to external data vendors with whom Alpaca has a close relationship if necessary.

# Error Responses

Options order operations (**submit**, **cancel**, **replace**, **exercise**, and **do-not-exercise**)  can return the errors listed below. Each error is delivered as a JSON body with a numeric `code` and a `message`, alongside the HTTP status. Example:&#x20;

```json
{
  "code": 40310000,
  "message": "insufficient options buying power (required: 20310, available: 9395)"
}
```

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  The `message` strings can change without notice. The numeric `code` and HTTP status are the stable contract. Placeholders in curly braces (`{symbol}`, `{required}`, `{available}`, `{status}`) are substituted at runtime.
</Callout>

The tables below are **options-specific**. Generic order errors (buying power, market closed, malformed JSON, rate-limit, etc.) documented under [Working with /orders](https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/working-with-orders) also apply to options.
