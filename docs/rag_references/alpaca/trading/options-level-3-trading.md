## What are Multi-leg Orders?

A multi-leg (MLeg) order is a single, combined order that includes multiple option contracts – calls, puts, or even shares—on the same underlying security. By bundling all legs together, the trade is executed as a single unit and each leg is associated with its own strike price, expiration date, or position type (long or short). MLeg orders are often used when traders need to set up complex strategies with several moving parts. A common example is the call spread, where the trader buys a call option at one strike price while simultaneously selling another call option at a higher strike, both for the same underlying asset.

## Why are Multi-leg Orders useful?

MLeg orders are particularly useful because they allow traders to execute complex options or stock combinations in one streamlined process, avoiding the delay or slippage risk of placing each transaction separately. By handling multiple legs at once, traders gain better control over their target price, reduce the chance of partial fills that could distort the intended strategy, and simplify trade management. The potential to minimize transaction costs—whether through tighter spreads, combined commissions, or efficient margin usage, also adds to their appeal.

A trader anticipates a stock will remain in a narrow price range.\
They set up an iron condor, which involves four legs:

* Buying one out-of-the-money (OTM) call.
* Selling a call at a closer strike.
* Buying an OTM put.
* Selling another put.

Placing these four legs as a single MLeg order ensures they fill together or not at all.\
This reduces the risk of partial fills, which could otherwise leave the trader with unwanted market exposure or unbalanced positions.

## How to submit a Multi-leg Order?

To submit a multi-leg (MLeg) order, set your “order\_class” to “mleg” and list each component of the strategy in a “legs” array, specifying details like the symbol, side (buy or sell), ratio quantity, and position intent (e.g., buy\_to\_open). Include any additional parameters (limit price, time in force, etc.) as part of the order’s settings. Below is a cURL example showing how to place a POST request to the Alpaca API, passing in the necessary headers and JSON payload:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url $APIDOMAIN/v2/orders \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header "Apca-Api-Key-Id: $APIKEY" \
     --header "Apca-Api-Secret-Key: $SECRET" \
     --data '

## Some deeper explanations

### How do we calculate maintenance margin requirements?

1. **Ignore Premiums**\
   When calculating maintenance margin, do not factor in the premiums paid or received. Instead, focus on the intrinsic (exercise) payoffs.
2. **Model Each Option’s Payoff**\
   Each option is represented by a piecewise linear payoff function (PnL) based on the underlying price (p).

   <Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/32286a51ed97659a53b176cec7edbe0df282c76a42831ac7f81dc7bf80c4d26d-Screenshot_2025-01-20_at_19.01.45.png" />
3. **Combine Positions**\
   To determine total payoff, sum the piecewise functions for all open positions:

   <Image align="center" width="400px" src="https://files.readme.io/995133508c4fd0176faf1c370ba26aa1444b74719ecbb3e3d6ec4cb2d3b8f77a-Screenshot_2025-01-20_at_19.05.08.png" />
4. **Find Theoretical Maximum Loss**\
   Maintenance margin is based on the worst-case scenario for the portfolio:

   <Image align="center" width="450px" src="https://files.readme.io/66772ec029ae5859d8c97d2e063ea2893faa9c0c794c8593ee2af5f7fe514111-Screenshot_2025-01-20_at_19.04.45.png" />

In other words, you determine the underlying price p that yields the lowest (most negative) net payoff. The absolute value of this lowest point is the margin requirement.

5. **Different Expirations**\
   For option positions with multiple expiration dates, calculate this theoretical maximum-loss approach separately for each expiration date, then use the largest resulting requirement across all expirations.

Lets see an example in order to understand why this way of calculating the maintenance margin is benefiting the customers.

Lets assume that a customer has the following positions

* Long Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 100
* Short Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 110
* Long Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 200
* Short Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 190

Using the traditional way of calculating maintenance margin we would form 2 spreads

Spread 1 (Call Credit Spread):

* Long Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 200
* Short Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 190

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/12a13471e5bdfaeb7669cac5d145b9f5ed1c7545b93c82999a38c447bde6f158-call_spread_1.png" />

With maintenance margin = 1000 since the difference between strike prices is 10 and the option’s multiplier is 100 so the `maintenance_margin = strike_price_diff * multiplier`

Spread 2 (Call Debit Spread):

* Long Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 100
* Short Call for AAPL with Strike Price = 110

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/ec7e1a5000f960cb984d595becc471067bafb8b8fa597cc08f15ac986c64aa88-call_spread_2.png" />

With maintenance margin = 0 since the difference between strike prices is 10 but the long is higher than the short.

So the **Total Maintenance Margin (Traditional) = 1000 + 0 = $1000**

**Universal Spread Rule Calculation**

When combining all four positions and evaluating the theoretical maximum combined loss, the payoff analysis shows that losses from one spread offset gains or losses in the other, resulting in a net theoretical maximum loss of zero. Hence:

* **Total Maintenance Margin (Universal Spread) = $0**

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/e30a3e59350972901aed6ff30df3409cba7f8115e4b88df66a9c33dfa8337bec-2_call_spreads.png" />

This “universal spread rule” or piecewise-payoff approach better reflects the true risk when these positions are considered together. By recognizing how the different calls offset one another’s exposures, the required margin is lower—benefiting the customer by aligning margin requirements with the actual worst-case scenario of the entire portfolio rather than assigning sums of individual spreads.

whichever is applicable, or the spread’s maximum potential loss, if any. To\

### How do we calculate order cost basis?

**Definition:**

The **cost basis** of a multi-leg (MLeg) order is the **sum of**:

1. The **maintenance margin** required for the combined positions (as determined by the universal spread rule), and
2. The **net price** (debit/credit) from buying or selling the option contracts.

**Example:**

Consider a call credit spread on AAPL:

* Long Call (buy) for AAPL with Strike Price = 200
* Short Call (sell) for AAPL with Strike Price = 190

**Maintenance Margin:** Universal spread rule requires a margin of $1,000 for this spread.

**Net Option Price:**

* The **long call** premium to be paid is $10 (cost to the buyer).
* The **short call** premium to be received is $15 (credit to the seller).
* **Net Price** = (15−10)=(15 - 10) =$5 credit
* Because each option contract covers 100 shares, multiply by 100:\
  Net Price (per contract) x 100 = 5 x 100 = $500
* However, for cost-basis purposes, a credit (positive $5) effectively reduces the overall cost, so it becomes **-$5** in the order’s net debit/credit calculation.

So, Total Cost Basis:\
Cost Basis = (Maintenance Margin) + (Net Price×Option Multiplier) = 1000 + (-5 x 100) = 1000 - 500 = $500

Hence, the cost basis—and the amount charged to the customer—for this multi-leg order is $500.

### Some Edge Scenarios

#### GCD `ratio_qty` requirement

When submitting an MLeg order, each leg’s `leg_ratio` must be in its simplest form. In other words, the greatest common divisor (GCD) among the `leg_ratio` values for the legs must be 1.

**Example** (wrong)

* Leg 1: `leg_ratio = 4`
* Leg 2: `leg_ratio = 2`

Because both ratios share a common divisor of 2, the system will reject this order. If a ratio must be 2:4, for instance, the user should enter it as 1:2 instead (dividing both sides by the GCD of 2).

**Reason for Enforcing Simplified Ratios**

By requiring that leg ratios be in their simplest form (prime to each other), the system can:

**Avoid Redundant Parent Quantities**: The ratio is intended to show the relative proportions of each leg; if the ratio isn’t simplified, you’re effectively duplicating the same information already available through the parent order quantity.

This approach ensures clarity in trade definitions and prevents potential confusion or errors in calculating fill quantities and margin requirements.

#### Restrictions on Combo Order(equity leg + contract leg)

MLeg orders that include an equity leg are not supported at this time. This means that combining an equity position with an options contract in a single order is not currently available for any trading strategy.

#### MLeg restrictions regarding uncovered legs

Starting on day zero of Options Level 3 trading, an MLeg order is accepted only if all its legs are covered within the same MLeg order. For example, an MLeg order containing two short call legs would be rejected, though submitting those short calls separately as single-leg orders is allowed. This restriction also impacts certain strategies, including rolling a short contract or rolling a calendar spread, since they would involve uncovered short legs within the same multi-leg order.
